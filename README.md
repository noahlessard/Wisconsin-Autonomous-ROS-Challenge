# Wisconsin-Autonomous-ROS-Challenge
My submission for the ROS coding challenge for the Wisconsin Autonomous Car Club

Currently this is written in python, but I'm thinking of upgrading to C++ once I'm sure the structure is correct. Also, this version still needs to have both the ros2 and package sourced before it works, and currently I can't find a way around that without having to modify the shell startup script, which won't work on someone else's machine.
